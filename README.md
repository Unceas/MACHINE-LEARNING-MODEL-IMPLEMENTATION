# MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION
PREDICTIVE MODEL USING SCIKITLEARN TO CLASSIFY OR PREDICT OUTCOMES FROM A DATASET

# 📧 Spam Email Classifier - Machine Learning Project


A machine learning project to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using text processing and classification techniques. Built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Pandas**.

## 🧠 Objective

To build a model that accurately classifies incoming messages as spam or not spam based on the email text using classical machine learning techniques.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍

- Pandas

- Scikit-learn
  
- NumPy
  
- Jupyter Notebook
- 

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset contains labeled messages (`spam`) with the actual email text.
  
- Format:

label,message

ham,"Hey, how are you?"

spam,"Congratulations! You have won a prize!


## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing noise, converting to lowercase, etc.
  
2. **Label Encoding**: Spam = 1, Ham = 0.
 
3. **Text Vectorization**: Using `CountVectorizer` to convert text to numerical features.
 
4. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes.
  
5. **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-classifier.git
 cd spam-email-classifier

2. Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python Spam_Email_Classifier_Task4.py

4. Or open the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Spam_Email_Classifier_Task4.ipynb


✅ Results
Achieved over 95% accuracy on the test dataset using Naive Bayes with text vectorization.
